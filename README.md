# Adventures in Learning React

This repo is a place for me to store the small projects I build as I learn React. They'll start small, and get bigger as I learn more.

### Project 1 - Background Changer

My first foray into React is a simple project to set the background color of a page based on rgb sliders, and update the color whenever the sliders are updated. A hex code is also provided for the currently selected color.
